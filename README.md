or

Place `index.js` in the `${DIRECTUS_PROJECT_ROOT_FOLDER}/extensions/layout/board-layout/`.

## Usage
- You must set a field interface to *dropdown* to choose as a Group By option.

## Current limitation
- No paging feature! I highly prioritize to add it.
- Many group derives too heavy API & SQL request.
